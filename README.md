# TCG-Pokellection

I developed this project within a tight timeframe of **four weeks** as a culmination of my academic journey during the **Capstone Final** at **Ogden-Weber Technical College**. The application was crafted using the .NET Maui framework and programmed in C#.

My application provides users with the ability to effortlessly explore and search for Pok√©mon Cards, while also seamlessly accessing their market value through the TCGPlayer.com API. Moreover, it boasts a user-friendly interface adaptable to various device themes. Regrettably, due to time constraints, I was unable to incorporate the **Collections** and **Related** tabs as initially planned.
